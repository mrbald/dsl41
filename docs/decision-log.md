# Decision log

- DL-01 New repo, dsl42 as quarry; forcing-function-first design (round-trip +
  equivalence as honesty checks) instead of constitution-first.
- DL-02 IR is AutoSys-shaped first; vendor neutrality emerges at Layer G.
- DL-03 Feature order: round-trip fidelity -> linter -> Mermaid -> equivalence
  validator -> DSL (extracted from corpus patterns, not designed up front).
- DL-04 Kept from dsl42 verbatim: pure compiler, no runtime; failed translation is
  a loud classified error, never silent loss.
- DL-05 Statement layer = hand scanner (spec: jil-statement-syntax.md); lark only
  for condition expressions. CFG for raw-to-EOL values is design theater.
- DL-06 Q1 precedence: both candidate grammars ship behind a switch; sentinel test
  proves they differ; losing rule deleted after live verification.
- DL-07 passthrough is strict-by-default: unknown attribute = lowering error unless
  allow-listed as inert (ir-design ss4).
- DL-08 UC backend client generated from /resources/openapi.json (UCS-12), not
  hand-written.
- DL-09 AGPL + commercial dual license; CLA from day one; clean-room corpus policy.
- DL-10 Repo codename dsl41; public product name decided later.
- DL-11 Linter phase readings (lint.py docstring is normative detail): L001
  checks local refs against the catalog and cross-instance refs only for a
  declared xinst (SEM-07 boundary markers are phase-5 material, not dangling
  refs); L002 scopes to $$VAR sites with a textual SET_GLOBAL producer
  heuristic over commands (value() atoms exempt -- runtime SET_GLOBAL from
  outside the catalog is routine); L003/L004 are enforced upstream (grammar/
  model/lowering) and stay registered as defensive scans so the ss9 code
  space holds. CLI exit contract: 0 clean, 1 findings (warn fails only with
  --strict), 2 parse/lowering refusal.
- DL-12 Derive phase readings (derive.py docstring is normative detail):
  n() mutex pairs, never components (exclusion is not transitive); the
  instantaneous mutual-exclusion reading applies ONLY to unqualified local
  n() in `condition` -- a lookback-qualified n() stays an edge (M03) so the
  qualifier is never silently lost. Same-cycle (M01) requires same top-level
  box, or equal trigger cadence with BOTH jobs unboxed -- two identically
  scheduled boxes are two UC workflows (M02), a signature collision is not a
  stream. Box-override membership is transitive (SEM-12 "inside the box"):
  M15 for any descendant, M16 otherwise. Edges whose producer is undefined
  in the catalog are cls=redesign (row M02 context): compiling an A-row edge
  to a nonexistent vertex would be silent loss; L001 carries the error.
  Structural passes run over local condition edges only; chain members
  inside a reported cycle are not double-reported as chains.
- DL-13 Oracle phase readings (oracle.py docstring is normative detail):
  SEM-11 fold gate is literal -- a box cannot complete while any non-bypassed
  member has not run, even if that member's condition is currently false
  (the hung-box pattern is real behavior, not a defect to smooth over).
  Re-evaluation is edge-triggered: a transition/SET_GLOBAL/ON_ICE wakes only
  jobs whose `condition` references the changed entity; completed consumers
  re-run on each fresh satisfaction (self-referencing conditions may loop --
  that is AutoSys's own re-trigger pattern, L010's concern, not the
  oracle's to prevent). A member's own date_conditions schedule gates with
  AND on top of the box gate (SEM-31/L013): members with schedules start
  only on their script-injected ticks. Iced jobs satisfy EVERY atom kind
  (f/t/e included) per SEM-05's blanket wording -- chosen over SEM-20's
  "as though it succeeded" reading; Q6-adjacent, revisit live -- but only
  once not RUNNING (ice on a running job takes effect at completion).
  FORCE_STARTJOB overrides hold and the box-RUNNING gate but never ice
  (SEM-20 "removed from all logic" wins). SEM-15 idle-box recompute: member
  transitions re-derive a non-running box's status (TERMINATED stays sticky
  per SEM-13). Injected STATUS may overwrite terminal states (CHANGE_STATUS
  analog; script-authoring hazard, documented not guarded).
- DL-14 Equivalence phase readings (equiv.py docstring is normative detail):
  tier b enumerates per-job STATE SPACE (status x lookback age buckets x
  Q2 same-day flag x exit-code cutpoints; globals over literal/cutpoint/
  UNSET/OTHER domains), not independent atom booleans -- independent atoms
  cannot see the s(x)&f(x) contradiction L006 exists for. The model
  deliberately decouples status from last exit code: unreachable states
  can only yield false INEQUIVALENCE or a missed warn, never a false
  equivalence claim. The ss6 BDD fallback (dd) is not taken v1 -- state
  spaces past 2^18 report too_large (tier-c only). In the free model every
  condition is falsifiable (all-RUNNING/unset-globals state), so L007
  evaluates box members with unstarted siblings pinned to NEVER_RAN (the
  "at box start" moment); plain tautology is vacuous by construction.
  Rename maps cover job names/box links/condition refs; globals and
  external instances are identity v1. Tier-b graph check compares
  canonical edge multisets + mutex groups + box tree (the v1 stand-in for
  ss6's bisimulation). Tier c excludes `cause` strings from trace
  comparison and applies the rename to catalog A's trace.
- DL-14a Amendment after the phase-8 adversarial review (both findings
  were confirmed false-equivalence claims, violating DL-14's own invariant):
  (1) string-global domains now carry region representatives for BOTH
  comparison behaviors of the oracle ("", lit+NUL string cutpoints plus
  v+-1 numeric cutpoints) -- the old single OTHER token made every ordered
  string comparison vacuously false and declared v(G)<"m" equivalent to
  v(G)>"m"; (2) the state space gained a per-job iced flag (SEM-05 parity)
  so s(x)&f(x) is no longer "equivalent" to s(y)&f(y). L006 deliberately
  keeps the ice-FREE question (icing is intervention, not scheduling) and
  its message says so; conds_equivalent always enumerates ice. L007 models
  box start with the oracle's catalog-order member starts (earlier siblings
  may be NEVER_RAN or RUNNING, later ones NEVER_RAN). too_large is
  inconclusive ("tier-c only"), never DIVERGENT. equiv_scripts covers the
  out-of-band event kinds and runtime-set globals (declared AND referenced,
  literal +- off-literal values); tier c guards rename collisions. Tier b/c
  are schedule-blind by scope -- tier a owns schedules (documented).
- DL-15 UC-backend U3-independent slice (backend_uc.py docstring is
  normative detail): compile_to_uc() raises BlockedOnU3 unconditionally --
  emitting records against a guessed schema would be silent loss with extra
  steps. classify_edges partitions E/A/R per Part II requirement 1; the
  migration report (requirement 3) pins catalog_hash + tool version, is
  deterministic (no timestamps), lists every refused edge with its source
  location, every assumption, M27 flags, M07 mutex groups, M12 OR shapes
  with lowering suggestions, the M33 boundary, and an open-question ledger
  filtered to the U-questions whose M-rows the catalog actually uses.
  `dsl41 report` always exits 0 on a generated report -- the report is the
  loud channel, the linter is the gate.
- DL-16 UC twin (backend_uc.UcModel/compile_twin + uc_oracle.py; docstrings
  are normative detail): compile_twin lowers E/A rows to an in-memory UC
  model (the structure the backend serializes post-U3) -- R rows, M27
  windows, notrunning-via edges, cross-workflow edges (Task Monitor
  territory), and unattachable global gates are excluded and recorded.
  M12 Or gets the NAIVE lowering (branch edges attach to the consumer;
  UC's skip-join makes that OR only for common-ancestor diamonds) --
  divergence is P-M12's point; restructure lowerings are U1-gated. The
  interpreter implements UCS-01/02/03/09/13 with documented U-defaults
  (M31 exit boundary, U8 read-at-evaluation variables); STARTJOB launches
  the containing workflow (one open instance v1); ice = Skip-at-start
  (M19), hold = M20, KILLJOB = Cancelled, FORCE starts within the open
  instance. The comparator drops STARTING (cosmetic AutoSys/UC lifecycle
  difference) and compares RUNNING/terminal/SKIPPED milestones per job;
  P-Mxx pairs assert divergence IS found where the mapping table predicts
  it and convergence holds for faithful shapes (chain, M19 contrast).
- DL-16a Amendment after the UC-twin adversarial review (three MAJORs,
  all confirmed): (1) UcEdgeCondition gained `cancelled` -- UC separates
  Cancelled from Failed (UCS-01/M06), so failure edges no longer fire on
  kills and M04's f() keeps its EXACT class; t() maps to `cancelled`.
  (2) Workflows are addressable by their own (box) name and by nested-box
  aliases (UCS-0 "workflows are themselves tasks"), so AutoSys-style
  STARTJOB(box) scripts drive both engines unchanged. (3) Global gates
  that cannot attach (every predecessor edge already carrying an M08
  var_condition) or attach only to some paths are RECORDED in the
  exclusion ledger, never silently dropped. Also: instance launch records
  INSTANCE->Running so box-named workflows compare cleanly against the
  AutoSys box lifecycle; FORCE_STARTJOB with no open instance launches the
  containing workflow then forces (M22 Launch analog); the comparator
  drops SKIPPED entries when comparing (an explicit UC Skip equals an
  AutoSys never-evaluated job; SKIPPED-vs-ran still diverges, raw payload
  kept for reporting); self-exclusion mutex is documented as subsumed by
  the one-open-instance rule.
- DL-17 DSL phase readings (dsl.py docstring is normative detail): the
  surface is exactly the four D2-named builders (job/box/sequence/
  parallel) plus record declarations, extracted from corpus patterns. The
  builder GENERATES JIL and lowers through the tested pipeline -- no
  second semantics path; values are validated against JIL's line
  discipline and refused loudly. Conditions stay strings in the existing
  condition language; cond_to_source renders Cond trees back with full
  structural fidelity (nested groups parenthesized for the flat parse).
  sequence()/parallel() refuse to merge onto jobs that already carry a
  condition (silent loss); the decompiler emits sequence() only for
  chains whose followers carry exactly s(prev) -- adjacency alone is not
  enough (the corpus's own mutex chain proves it) -- and leaves everything
  else as explicit job(condition=...) calls. The round-trip property
  (decompile -> exec -> canonical-hash equality) holds corpus-wide and is
  the phase's mechanical adversarial check.
- DL-18 Estate-shape hardening after the first real-sample dry run
  (2026-07-09). The failing shapes and the decisions they forced:
  (1) scanner -- insert_resource/update_resource/delete_resource are
  statement boundaries (rule 3 amendment), and an attribute-position key
  shaped like a subcommand ((insert|update|delete|override)_*) that is NOT
  in the recognized set is a scanner ERROR: the observed failure was
  insert_resource silently folding into the preceding insert_machine, and
  statement-boundary loss is silent structural loss. (2) ir -- ResourceIR
  carried opaquely (name + res_type + verbatim attrs), mirroring
  MachineIR's documented opaque-v1 stance; UCS-09/M34 map resources to UC
  Virtual Resources when the backend lands. `status:` on insert lowers to
  Semantics.initial_status restricted to INACTIVE/ON_HOLD/ON_ICE/ON_NOEXEC
  (SEM-24 [A]); anything else -- especially run states, which would
  interact with the SEM-01 latch -- is a loud lowering error.
  alarm_if_terminated joins the annotation class beside alarm_if_fail.
  (3) oracle -- initial_status seeds the SEM-20/21/22 flags before the
  first event, no trace entry (T24a/b). (4) backend_uc -- compile_twin
  records definition-time state in the exclusion ledger rather than
  modeling it v1 (UC "Hold on Start" / M20 is the eventual E-class
  target); the AutoSys-vs-twin comparator therefore diverges on such
  catalogs, which is the correct polarity (divergence surfaces, silent
  agreement never fabricated). (5) dsl -- resource() builder + status=
  kwarg emission keep the corpus-wide decompile round-trip property.
- DL-19 `~{$NAME}~` placeholder resolver as a NON-CORE preprocessor
  (placeholders.py + `dsl41 resolve`, 2026-07-09). Estate JIL is templated
  by an external properties mechanism BEFORE `jil` sees it; we reproduce
  that step standalone so the compiler core never models templating
  (nothing in the core imports the module; the scanner keeps treating
  unresolved tokens as opaque name characters per the DL-18 fixtures).
  Pinned semantics (module docstring is normative detail): properties are
  KEY=VALUE split on the first '=', '#'/'!' comments; references are legal
  in both key and value; resolution is an order-independent fixpoint, so
  use-before-define and nested tokens work; later files override earlier
  by RAW key (layering is the point of 1+ files) while within-file
  duplicates and same-resolved-key collisions are errors; anything still
  `~{...}~`-shaped after substitution -- undefined name or malformed
  lookalike -- is a loud error with file:line, escapable per DL-07
  convention via --permit-unresolved (carried verbatim + reported).
- DL-20 Estate-scale hardening (2026-07-09; root-caused from a field report
  of `dsl41 lint` being OOM-killed). Three defects, one cause each:
  (1) derive computed backward-reachability ancestor sets for EVERY catalog
  job although only the Or-shape pass consumes them -- Theta(n^2) memory on
  chain-shaped estates (741MB at 5k jobs, measured; OOM kill at real estate
  sizes). Ancestors are now computed iteratively and only for Or-branch
  producers: a catalog with no `|` pays nothing, and the iterative closure
  is additionally COMPLETE on cyclic graphs where the old memoized
  recursion returned order-dependent partial sets. (2) the same recursion
  made success-vs-RecursionError depend on declaration order (reverse-
  declared chains crashed) -- gone with the iterative walk. (3) the
  condition Tree->Cond transformer recursed once per operator down the
  LALR left spine, so ~1000-atom flat chains crashed with a RecursionError
  traceback AND exit code 1, which the CLI contract reserves for lint
  findings. The spine walk is iterative now (long flat chains are fine and
  stay n-ary/shallow downstream); genuinely deep GROUPING beyond the
  walker budget is refused as a loud ConditionParseError (exit-2 class)
  because every downstream Cond walker recurses per nesting level --
  admitting the parse would only move the crash.
- DL-21 `resources:` job attribute -- the 11.3+ resource-object job side
  (2026-07-09). Root cause of the gap: the dossier ss5 inventory was NOT
  based on an old spec (it cites TechDocs 12.x) but had parked the whole
  resource/placement class as opaque and only ENUMERATED the legacy
  pre-11.3 load-balancing attributes (job_load/priority/QUE_WAIT), so the
  DL-07 firewall refused `resources:` as unknown; DL-18 had added only the
  definition side (insert_resource statements). Now, verified against
  TechDocs 12.x/24.0: `resources: (name, QUANTITY=n[, FREE=Y|N|A]) AND
  (...)` (FREE: Y=free on success, N=never, A=unconditional; res_type
  D|R|T; amount required; optional agent-level machine). Decisions:
  lowering types each group into JobIR.resources (ResourceRef), keywords
  and the AND separator case-insensitive (estates write lowercase `and`);
  malformed groups, unknown group keywords, non-integer/absent QUANTITY,
  and FREE outside Y/N/A are loud lowering errors; FREE absent stays None
  (the engine default is not guessed); no oracle gate semantics v1
  (Resource Wait/QUE_WAIT out of interpreter scope, dossier ss5 row);
  resource references are NOT validated against catalog.resources
  (mirrors machine refs -- estates split definitions across files); the
  compile twin records requirements in the exclusion ledger on the M34
  row (its target column is already Virtual Resources / UCS-09) rather
  than minting a new M row outside a Part II review; the decompiler
  renders groups canonically so the corpus round-trip holds.
- DL-22 Preprocessing as a first-class CLI step (2026-07-09). Field
  finding: templated values in TYPED lanes (start_times etc.) correctly
  refuse `~{$NAME}~` tokens at lowering -- and per DL-19 the core must
  never learn templating -- so processing a templated estate needs the
  resolve step fused into the workflow, not looser typing. Decisions:
  (1) every catalog-consuming command (lint/equiv/report/decompile/viz)
  accepts --properties/-p and resolves each input before parsing;
  substitution is within-line, so diagnostics keep real file:line
  positions; placeholder failures join the exit-2 class ("input never
  reached the tool"); equiv applies one binding set to both catalogs.
  (2) `dsl41 resolve` accepts several files and concatenates them in
  argument order into one output -- a missing final newline between
  inputs is completed in that input's own newline style, and merging LF
  with CRLF inputs is refused loudly (rule 10 would make the merged text
  unparseable anyway). Typed lanes stay strict on unresolved tokens:
  preprocessing IS the supported path for templated estates.
- DL-23 `dsl41 lint --suppress CODE` (2026-07-09). Field finding: estates
  that carry `timezone:` on every job as a convention drown the report in
  L005. Re-verified first that L005's premise holds for timezone: the
  TechDocs date_conditions page itself lists timezone (plus run_window
  and must_*_times) among the attributes it gates, and secondary sources
  corroborate "date_conditions unset => Days/Time attributes ignored";
  one Q2-adjacent corner (does per-job timezone re-base the lookback-0
  midnight anchor?) is recorded as [?] on SEM-35, not guessed. Decisions:
  suppression is per-CODE and CLI-level only (lint_catalog stays
  complete -- suppression is a reporting choice, not a semantics one);
  suppressed codes drop from both the output and the exit code; unknown
  codes in --suppress are an exit-2 error, because a typo silently
  suppressing nothing would be its own silent loss.
- DL-24 L015 severity split (2026-07-09, field calibration). Estates use
  bare-hours lookbacks (`s(job, 12)` = 12 hours) deliberately; the shape
  is valid, Broadcom-documented, and unambiguous to the ENGINE -- the
  only risk is an author who believed minutes. It is now INFO (printed,
  never gates the exit code, --strict included; ir-design ss9 row
  amended). Single-digit minutes (`2.5` = 2h05m, not two-and-a-half
  hours) stays WARN -- that token genuinely reads as a decimal. Full
  silence for either remains `--suppress L015` (DL-23).
- DL-25 Dangling-name audit (2026-07-09; field report: unknown resource
  references were silent). Every named cross-reference reviewed; the
  catalog-assembly linter is the home for existence checks (lowering
  stays per-file tolerant, DL-21). Already covered: condition job refs +
  undeclared ^INSTANCE (L001 error), box_name (lowering hard error),
  $$VAR substitution sites (L002 error). Gaps closed: (1) L016 warn --
  `resources:` names a resource with no insert_resource in the set (warn
  not error: AutoSys resolves against its DB, but the UC backend cannot
  size the Virtual Resource, M34/UCS-09). (2) L017 warn -- `machine:`
  outside the set's machine records, fired ONLY when the set defines at
  least one machine (job-only slices keep machine defs out of scope by
  convention and stay quiet); comma lists (legacy load-balancing) are
  checked per name; boxes skipped (inert passthrough). The corpus now
  models a complete estate (machines_base.jil). (3) L002 extended to
  v(NAME) condition atoms at WARN, not error -- an unset global read can
  be an INTENDED cross-system gate (sem12's external gate is exactly
  that); the extension immediately surfaced two real dangling v() reads
  the corpus already carried. (4) Calendars are autocal territory, not
  definable in JIL, so "unknown calendar" is undecidable for the linter:
  the migration report inventories referenced calendars per job and adds
  M24 (and M26 for schedule timezones) to the used rows so the U6 parity
  question finally surfaces when calendars are actually in play.
  Documented out of scope: owner/profile (OS/machine-side names), the
  machine-record `machine:` attr (opaque v1, DL-18), watch_file paths.
- DL-26 L007 vacuous-pin false positive (2026-07-09; field report: L007
  fired on a vanilla s(prev) chain inside a box). Root cause in
  cond_truth_profile, not the box-start pinning: rule_l007 pins ALL
  siblings, but a sibling the condition never references is not in the
  condition's truth-table alphabet, so the fixed-status check read None,
  failed the allowed-set test, and skipped EVERY state -- zero states
  enumerated, falsifiable=False by vacuity, every conditioned member of
  any 3+-member box reported as a tautology. The two-member quiet tests
  never had an unreferenced sibling, which is how it survived phase 8's
  review. Fix: a pin on an unreferenced job is vacuous (it cannot affect
  that condition's truth) and is ignored; regression tests pin the chain
  shape quiet and a genuine n(later) tautology still firing beside an
  unreferenced bystander. Also corrected in the same session: the L007
  message's justification -- member conditions ARE re-evaluated
  event-driven during the box run (that is how in-box sequencing works);
  first-evaluation pinning is sound because a member runs at most once
  per box execution (SEM-10), so a condition that cannot be false at
  first evaluation never gets a second evaluation at all.
- DL-27 `rename_job` recognized at the statement layer (2026-07-10; found by
  the Broadcom 12.x doc sweep, not a field report). TechDocs 12.0.01+
  documents `rename_job` ("renames an existing job and updates
  dependencies"); its `rename_` verb was outside the DL-18 guard shape, so
  the scanner silently folded the statement -- and everything after it --
  into the preceding statement: the exact failure class DL-18 exists to
  stop, reintroduced by an incomplete verb list. Fix: `rename_job` added to
  SUBCOMMANDS, `rename` added to the guard verbs, lowering keeps refusing
  it loudly (rename is merge semantics like update/delete/override, out of
  compile scope). Lesson recorded in the spec: the guard's verb list is
  part of the subcommand inventory it protects; re-check it against the
  vendor subcommand page whenever the recognized set changes. The
  companion new-name attribute is carried generically (its exact name is
  immaterial to scanning and unverified against the page body).
- DL-28 insert_xinst plumbing carried opaquely (2026-07-10; 12.x doc sweep).
  TechDocs 12.1 documents six insert_xinst attributes -- xtype, xmachine
  (required in all cases), xport (required for xtype a/e), xmanager
  (required for xtype e), optional xcrypt_type/xkey_to_manager. The v1
  lowering refused everything except xtype, so no documented-valid
  external-instance JIL could lower at all, blocking SEM-07 cross-instance
  estates. Resolution: `XinstIR` (name, typed xtype, verbatim attrs, span),
  the exact MachineIR/ResourceIR boundary-record stance -- xtype is the one
  field conditions/L001 depend on; connection plumbing is the engine's
  concern. Required-ness of xmachine/xport is NOT enforced (lowering stays
  per-file tolerant, DL-21/DL-25 line); an L-rule can add that check if a
  field report ever asks for it. DSL builder/decompiler grew **attrs
  passthrough to match.
- DL-29 Full 12.1 subcommand inventory at the statement layer (2026-07-10;
  doc sweep). TechDocs 12.1 documents monbro (insert/update/delete),
  job_type objects (insert/update/delete), delete_blob, insert/delete_glob,
  and connectionprofile (insert/update/delete) subcommands the scanner did
  not recognize. They match the DL-18 guard shape, so the failure was loud
  -- but a loud stop on a VALID estate file means F1 fidelity is impossible
  over input the engine accepts. Resolution: the scanner recognizes the
  complete documented inventory (statement boundaries, byte-faithful
  round-trip); lowering refuses the out-of-scope object classes with the
  classified error. Scan-everything/lower-selectively is the layering DL-05
  always intended.
- DL-30 Rule 4b: one attribute pair per attribute line, loudly (2026-07-10;
  doc sweep). Broadcom's JIL syntax rules permit several `attr: value`
  statements on one line and require value colons to be escaped (`\:`) or
  quoted. The scanner took everything after the first colon as value, so a
  legal second pair was swallowed silently -- invisible to DL-07 because it
  hides inside another attribute's value (e.g. `machine: prod priority: 5`
  lowers as machine="prod priority: 5"). Resolution: the rule-4 inline-pair
  detector now also runs over attribute values; a whitespace-preceded,
  unescaped, unquoted `key:`-shaped token is a scanner error naming the fix
  (split the line / escape / quote). On valid JIL this costs nothing (the
  DL-18 argument): valid values never contain that shape. F4's
  "key:-lookalikes are value text" pin narrows to non-pair shapes (path
  colons, digit-led times, quoted/escaped text) -- fixtures kept proving
  those; autorep -q emits one attribute per line, so estate exports are
  unaffected.
- DL-31 Mid-line `#` is value text (2026-07-10; doc sweep). Broadcom
  defines `#` line comments "in the first column" and lists `#` among
  valid name AND value characters; the scanner's whitespace-preceded
  `#`-to-EOL trailing-comment strip therefore silently changed values
  relative to the engine's parse (`command: run.sh # nightly` lowered as
  "run.sh"). Resolution: `#` comments are full-line only (first
  non-whitespace character; leading indentation accepted as harmless
  leniency); a mid-line `#` stays in the value. Trailing comments remain
  supported via `/* ... */` only. Preserve-mode rendering was never
  affected (text kept verbatim); this changes the TYPED lane. Residual [?]
  in rule 5: live-jil behavior for indented and mid-line `#` -- flip back
  deliberately if a live check ever contradicts the doc.
- DL-32 12.x attribute lanes completed for CMD/BOX/FW scope (2026-07-10;
  doc sweep). Attributes TechDocs 12.x documents as valid on the three
  in-scope job types were DL-07 hard errors. Routed by semantics class:
  ANNOTATION (observability, no control flow): heartbeat_interval
  (MISSING_HEARTBEAT alarm) + the notification-services family
  (notification_alarm_types/_template/_emailaddress_on_*). PASSTHROUGH
  (inert carry): machine_method (joins job_load/priority placement row),
  job_class, avg_runtime, ulimit, elevated, interactive, and chk_files --
  chk_files has teeth (unmet space -> alarm, no start) but is Resource-Wait
  class like `resources` (DL-21): typed/oracle treatment deferred until a
  consumer exists. TYPED (ExecSpec, CMD-only): std_in_file (stdin redirect,
  may name a blob) and envvars (NAME=value list) -- verbatim values,
  $$VAR-indexed (SEM-08); error on FW like command, inert on BOX like the
  base exec cluster. Extended-job-type attribute families (ftp_*, i5_*,
  hadoop_*, oracle_*, ps_*, j2ee_*, ...) stay out: those job_types are
  refused at lowering, so their attributes are unreachable -- no allow-list
  entries for unreachable semantics. SEM-24 upgraded [A]->[V] (existence)
  in the same sweep: TechDocs 12.0.01 documents `status:` on insert with
  the no-update/override constraint; full documented value set still [?].
- DL-33 success_codes / fail_codes complete the SEM-09 boundary (2026-07-10;
  doc sweep). TechDocs documents both on Command/i5/Micro Focus/z/OS jobs:
  comma lists of codes and lo-hi ranges; absence-defaults "0 is success" /
  "non-zero is failure". Both were DL-07 errors, and SEM-09 modeled the
  boundary as max_exit_success alone -- the one true semantics gap the
  sweep found. Resolution: typed Semantics fields (sorted ranges, never
  merged; CMD-only via model validator -- a box's verdict is the SEM-11
  fold); ONE verdict function `ir.exit_is_success` shared by the oracle
  and the UC twin (M31's same-boundary assumption now holds by
  construction, U4 unchanged); compile_twin exports the sets. The docs do
  NOT state the composition -- that is the new Q7 (dossier ss9), pinned to
  the conservative direction (never invent a SUCCESS): fail_codes wins;
  a present success_codes replaces the success rule (unmatched -> FAILURE,
  threshold ignored); fail_codes alone falls through to the threshold.
  Trace tests T09b/c/d pin the corners; replace defaults only from a live
  instance, per the Q-discipline.
- DL-34 Accepted leniencies vs the 12.x syntax pages (2026-07-10; doc
  sweep, deliberately NOT changed -- relitigate here, not in code review):
  (1) grammar JOB_NAME/INSTANCE_NAME accept @/$ beyond the documented
  object-name charset [a-zA-Z0-9._#-] -- superset reading of migration
  input, harmless; (2) documented `\,` escaped commas in values are not
  honored by list splitting -- only bites list attrs whose member names
  contain commas (calendars), none observed; (3) the 4096-character
  statement limit is unenforced -- matters only if canonical output is fed
  back to a real jil binary, lint-candidate if that becomes a flow;
  (4) `machine` is doc-required on FW jobs but lowering does not require
  it -- requiredness is the engine's concern (DL-28 line), lint-candidate.
  Also recorded: Broadcom's own lookback example writes the word `AND`
  inside a condition, vindicating the grammar's word-operator support
  (grammars/condition.lark already accepts and/or case-insensitively).
- DL-34a Adversarial-review addendum (2026-07-10). Two findings from the
  post-sweep Opus review: (1) FIXED -- rule 4b fired on a `key:` shape
  inside a retained closed inline block comment (rule 5 keeps those as
  opaque value text); the 4b scan now masks closed `/*...*/` spans first.
  (2) ACCEPTED-LATENT -- the DSL decompiler emits record attrs as builder
  kwargs, so a machine/resource/xinst attribute literally named `name`
  would collide with the positional param when the decompiled module is
  executed; pre-existing pattern shared by all three builders, no
  documented JIL attribute has that name, and the failure is a loud
  TypeError. Fix if it ever fires: dict-splat fallback in decompile.
